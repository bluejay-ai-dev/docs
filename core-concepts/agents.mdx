## Agents

Agents are central to Bluejay's ability to run simulations and provide detailed observability into your production calls. All simulations are ran against an agent, and all observability is performed with respect to an agent.

### What is an Agent?

In Bluejay, an **Agent** is a representation of the voice agent you want to test/monitor. Bluejay uses the information you provide to establish a baseline for how the agent should perform.

### Creating an Agent

To create an Agent on Bluejay, you'll need to provide the following details:

- **Name**
  - A unique, easily identifiable name for your agent. This helps you track performance and manage multiple agents efficiently.

- **Description**
  - A brief explanation of the agentâ€™s role, capabilities, and context. This helps Bluejay simulations accurately reflect your agent's intended function.

- **Goals**
  - Clearly defined objectives your agent aims to achieve during calls. These can include customer service resolution, sales targets, appointment scheduling, or information dissemination.

- **Knowledge Base**
  - A structured collection of data, scripts, FAQs, or guidelines your agent uses during interactions. Providing a comprehensive knowledge base enhances the accuracy of simulations and the quality of observability insights.

- **Phone Number**
  - The phone number associated with your agent for making or receiving production calls. This is essential for accurate tracking and performance analysis.

### Why are Agents Important?

Agents form the foundation of your interaction strategy on Bluejay. By clearly defining and accurately detailing your agents, you enable:

- Precise call simulations that reflect real-world scenarios.
- Robust analytics and observability insights into agent performance.
- Effective optimization of agent behaviors based on data-driven feedback.

### Best Practices for Defining Agents

- **Be Specific:** Clear, detailed descriptions and goals ensure your agent's simulations and analytics are highly relevant and actionable.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep your knowledge base and agent details up-to-date to reflect any changes in strategy or information.
- **Distinct Names:** Use intuitive and descriptive agent names for quick identification and easier management.
