## Simulation Runs

Simulation runs are individual executions or instances of your configured simulations on Bluejay. Each simulation run generates detailed, actionable insights into your voice agent's performance, enabling precise analysis and informed optimization.

### What is a Simulation Run?

A **Simulation Run** represents one execution instance of a specific simulation scenario. When you initiate a simulation run, Bluejay's digital humans engage your voice agent through realistic interactions, allowing you to measure detailed performance outcomes in a controlled environment.

### Exploring Simulation Run Results

Each simulation run provides an interactive performance dashboard, offering comprehensive insights into how your voice agent interacted with each digital human. Key metrics and data points available include:

- **Redundancy and Hallucination Checks**
  - Evaluates instances where your agent repeats unnecessary information or provides inaccurate or irrelevant responses.

- **Average Latency**
  - Measures response speed, capturing how quickly your agent replies during interactions.

- **Goal Outcomes (Pass/Fail)**
  - Clearly identifies whether your voice agent achieved the predefined goals in each interaction scenario.

- **Call Statuses**
  - Summarizes the outcomes and statuses of individual calls (e.g., successful, escalated, dropped), enabling quick identification of areas needing attention.

- **Agent Speaking Percentage**
  - Shows how much your agent spoke relative to the customer, indicating conversational balance and engagement.

### Detailed Call Insights

Beyond high-level metrics, each simulation run offers detailed, individual call-level data, including:

- **Call Logs**
  - Comprehensive logs tracking every interaction step and agent response during a call.

- **Transcripts**
  - Complete text records of each call, enabling precise review and analysis of conversation flow and agent performance.

- **Recordings**
  - Audio recordings of interactions, providing invaluable context for qualitative evaluation and training purposes.

- **Additional Call-specific Data**
  - Contextual information such as timestamps, customer emotion, agent response accuracy, and scenario-specific details to deeply understand each interaction.

### Why are Simulation Runs Important?

Simulation runs provide critical data-driven insights, enabling you to:

- Continuously track and benchmark agent performance in realistic, repeatable conditions.
- Identify and resolve issues with precise, actionable metrics.
- Refine agent behavior iteratively based on measurable results and clear feedback loops.

### Best Practices for Using Simulation Runs

- **Regular Execution:** Perform simulation runs frequently to continuously monitor and enhance your agent's effectiveness.
- **Analyze Trends Over Time:** Compare multiple simulation runs to detect patterns and measure long-term performance improvements or regressions.
- **Detailed Reviews:** Utilize call logs, transcripts, and recordings to conduct thorough qualitative analyses, supporting quantitative data.
