## Simulations

Simulations in Bluejay represent structured scenarios where Digital Humans interact with your voice agents through realistic phone call environments. These simulations enable comprehensive testing, performance tracking, and iterative improvements of your agents over time.

### What is a Simulation?

A **Simulation** is a carefully constructed scenario composed of multiple Digital Humans designed to test and evaluate your voice agent’s effectiveness. Each simulation encapsulates specific interactions aligned with the goals, behaviors, and profiles you've defined, allowing for precise assessment and targeted refinement.

### Creating and Managing Simulations

When creating a simulation on Bluejay, you specify a set of Digital Humans designed to interact with your agent. Each simulation can be precisely configured and includes the following capabilities:

- **Re-runnable Scenarios**
  - Simulations can be repeatedly executed to consistently measure and analyze agent performance over multiple iterations.

- **Customizable Digital Humans**
  - Adjust or modify Digital Humans within simulations to test various customer profiles, behaviors, emotions, or interaction styles.

- **Progress Tracking**
  - Observe detailed progress and performance metrics across each simulation run, clearly highlighting improvements or regressions.

### Why are Simulations Valuable?

Simulations provide critical insights and measurable benchmarks that help you to:

- Identify strengths and weaknesses in your agent’s handling of different customer scenarios.
- Iteratively improve agent responses and behaviors using consistent, repeatable tests.
- Track and validate improvements or regressions systematically, ensuring continuous optimization of your agent’s performance.

### Best Practices for Effective Simulations

- **Clearly Define Objectives:** Establish specific goals for each simulation to effectively measure your agent’s performance against desired outcomes.
- **Iterative Testing:** Regularly re-run simulations to capture incremental improvements and address emerging issues promptly.
- **Scenario Diversity:** Employ a broad array of Digital Humans to reflect diverse, realistic customer interaction environments, thereby ensuring your agent can handle a wide range of situations confidently.

### Example Simulation Configuration

```md
Simulation Name: "Billing Support Stress Test"

Digital Humans Included:
- Frustrated customer disputing charges
- Calm customer seeking billing clarification
- Impatient customer requesting immediate assistance

Simulation Objectives:
- Measure agent’s ability to manage high-pressure scenarios
- Evaluate consistency of information provided across interactions
- Track improvements in de-escalation skills over successive runs
