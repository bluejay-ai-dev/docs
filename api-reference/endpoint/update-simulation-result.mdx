The simulation result ID can be found as a header of the websocket connect message. The header will look like this: 

`X-Simulation-Result-Id: <simulation_result_id>`

This ID associates your tool calls, events, tags, and metadata with the specific simulation result.
Given this ID, this endpoint updates your simulation result to enrich the simulation with the tool calls, events, tags, and metadata you provide.
