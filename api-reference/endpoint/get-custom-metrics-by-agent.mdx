This endpoint allows you to retrieve all custom metrics associated with a specific agent. Provide the agent ID in the path to get a list of all custom metrics configured for that agent.

**DEPRECATED**: This endpoint is deprecated. Please use `GET /custom-metrics?agent_id={agent_id}` instead, which supports pagination and additional features.
