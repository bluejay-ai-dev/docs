This guide will walk you through how to connect your Miro boards to Bluejay's workflow system. You can import Miro boards as conversation workflows to visualize and evaluate your agent's conversation paths.


## Quick Prerequisites

- **Miro Account**
- **A Bluejay Account**
- **A Miro Board** with connected nodes representing conversation flows

## Setting Up the Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Miro API Key">
    Go to the **Miro Development Platform** and create your app:

1. Navigate to [https://developers.miro.com](https://developers.miro.com)
2. **Create an account** or log into your existing Miro account
3. **Create a new app** by clicking "Create new app"
4. In the app settings, go to the **Permissions** tab
5. Click the checkboxes for **`boards:read`** and **`boards:write`** permissions

6. Click **"Install app and get OAuth token"**
7. Select a development team
8. **Copy the OAuth token** - this is your Miro API key

<Warning>
**Important:** Do not select "User authorization token" when creating your app. This integration requires the standard OAuth token for proper functionality.
</Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Bluejay Integration">
    Add your Miro API key to Bluejay:

1. Log into your **Bluejay Dashboard**
2. Click on your **Account** button in the bottom left corner
3. Select the **Integrations** option
4. Locate the **Miro API Key** input field
5. **Paste your Miro OAuth token** into the field
6. Click **"Save Miro Configuration"**

  </Step>

  <Step title="Import Your First Miro Workflow">
    Create a workflow from your Miro board:

1. Navigate to the **Workflows** section in Bluejay
2. Click **"Create New Workflow"**
3. Select **"Import from Miro"** option
4. **Choose your Miro board** from the dropdown list
5. Give your workflow a **name**

### Miro Board Requirements

Your Miro board must follow these structure requirements for successful import:

#### Connection Rules
- **Exactly one start node**: Only one node should have no incoming connections (arrows pointing to it)
- **At least one end node**: At least one node should have no outgoing connections (arrows from it)
- **All nodes must be connected**: Disconnected nodes will be excluded from the workflow
- **No duplicate connections**: Each connection between nodes must be unique

#### Supported Elements
- **Cards, Shapes, and Sticky Notes**: These will be converted to workflow nodes
- **Connectors/Arrows**: These will be converted to workflow edges
- **Text Content**: Node labels will be extracted from the text content of your Miro elements

<Note>
**AI-generated features and imagery are not yet supported.** Only manually created cards, shapes, sticky notes, and connectors will be imported.
</Note>

#### Node Types (Auto-detected)
- **Start Node**: Node with no incoming connections - represents conversation start
- **End Node**: Node with no outgoing connections - represents conversation end  
- **Editable Node**: Node with both incoming and outgoing connections - represents intermediate conversation steps

### Common Issues

**"No start node found"**: Make sure exactly one node has no arrows pointing to it

**"Multiple start nodes detected"**: Connect extra starting nodes to other nodes or remove them

**"No connected items found"**: Ensure your nodes are connected with arrows/connectors

**"No end node found"**: Make sure at least one node has no arrows going out from it
