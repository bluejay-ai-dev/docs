## Pipecat

If your agent is running with the Pipecat framework this is an easy way to simulate calls to your agent. We will manage the transport connection and place our digital human directly in communication with your agent.

### Connection model

Bluejay will connect to your Pipecat agent's transport layer and establish a bidirectional audio/data stream, allowing our digital human to interact with your agent in real-time.

## Quick Start

1. **Deploy Pipecat Agent**: deploy an agent to pipecat cloud following Pipecat's [Quickstart](https://docs.pipecat.ai/getting-started/quickstart)
2. **Add Pipecat [Public Key](https://docs.pipecat.ai/deployment/pipecat-cloud/fundamentals/accounts-and-organizations#public-api-keys)**: 
  1. Retrieve your Pipecat Public API key from the pipecat dashboard
    1. Navigate to the API Keys tab
    2. Locate Pipecat Cloud API Keys and select the public tab
    3. Create a new key and copy it
  2. Input Pipecat Public API key into bluejay dashboard
    1. Select your organization in the bottom left of the screen
    2. Select Integrations
    3. Locate Pipecat and add your Pipecat public key
3. **Create Bluejay Agent**: 
  1. Select `Pipecat Direct` as the Connection Type
  2. Enter your pipecat agent name (the one from `pcc-deploy.toml`)
4. **Create a Simulation**
5. **Run the Simulation**
6. **View Results**
