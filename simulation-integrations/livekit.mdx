## Livekit

If your agent is running with the livekit agents framework this is an easy way to simulate calls to your agent. We will manage room and token creation and place our digital human directly in the room with your agent.

### Connection model

Bluejay will create a room inside of your livekit cloud instance and dispatch your agent to the room before minting a token and having our digital human join the room.

## Quick Start

1. **Add Your Livekit Credentials**: Add your livekit `api_key`, `api_secret`, and `url` in the integrations tab in settings.
2. **Add You Agent Name**: In the Agent Connection setting of your agent, add the name your agent uses or leave it blank to dispatch you default agent.
2. **Create a Simulation**: Set up test scenarios with customer personas
3. **Run the Test**: Bluejay automatically handles the call setup
4. **Get Results**: View detailed analytics, transcripts, and recordings

## Room Metadata

Optionally, you can add any metadata you want to be included in the room on room creation. Simply add the JSON metadata to the metadata section in the Agent Connection settings.
