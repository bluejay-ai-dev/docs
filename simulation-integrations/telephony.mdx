# Telephony Integration

Bluejay makes it incredibly simple to test your voice agents using just a phone number. Provide a phone number, and Bluejay handles all the telephony infrastructure to connect with your agent.

## Quick Start

Testing your voice agent is straightforward:

1. **Add Your Phone Number**: Configure your agent with any valid phone number
2. **Create a Simulation**: Set up test scenarios with customer personas
3. **Run the Test**: Bluejay automatically handles the call setup
4. **Get Results**: View detailed analytics, transcripts, and recordings

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "name": "Customer Support Agent",
    "phone_number": "+15551234567",
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful customer support agent..."
  }
}
```

No complex setup, no infrastructure management, no telephony expertise required.

## Inbound vs Outbound Testing

Understanding simulation testing directions is crucial for effective voice agent evaluation. Bluejay supports both testing approaches based on who initiates the call.

### Outbound Testing (Default)

In outbound testing, **Bluejay calls your agent** to simulate incoming customer calls.

#### How It Works
1. You provide your agent's phone number or SIP endpoint
2. Bluejay initiates calls to your agent using digital humans
3. The simulated customer (persona) interacts with your agent
4. Your agent responds as it would to real incoming calls

#### Characteristics
- **Immediate Execution**: Tests run as soon as triggered
- **Multiple Iterations**: Can repeat the same test multiple times
- **High Control**: Bluejay controls timing and execution
- **Synchronous Results**: Get results immediately after completion
- **High Concurrency**: Support for simultaneous calls

#### Use Cases
Perfect for testing:
- **Customer Service Lines**: Support hotlines, help desks
- **IVR Systems**: Automated phone menus and call routing
- **Receptionist Agents**: Virtual assistants answering calls
- **Emergency Response**: Crisis hotlines, urgent support
- **Product Support**: Technical support scenarios

### Inbound Testing

In inbound testing, **your agent calls Bluejay** to simulate outbound campaigns and proactive scenarios.

#### How It Works
1. Bluejay provisions phone numbers for each test case
2. Your agent system initiates calls to Bluejay's provisioned numbers
3. Bluejay answers as the simulated customer (persona)
4. Your agent conducts the outbound call scenario

#### Triggering Inbound Calls
**Automatic Triggering (Recommended)**:
- Configure an HTTP endpoint that Bluejay calls to trigger your agent
- Bluejay passes the provisioned number as `{{phoneNumberToDial}}`
- Your system initiates the call automatically

**Manual Calls**:
- Bluejay displays provisioned numbers in the simulation interface
- You manually trigger your agent to call the provided numbers

#### Characteristics
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Tests wait for your agent to initiate calls
- **Agent-Controlled Timing**: Your system decides when to call
- **Single Iteration**: One test per provisioned number
- **Pending State**: Test cases remain pending until called
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for pending tests

#### Use Cases
Perfect for testing:
- **Sales Campaigns**: Cold calling, lead follow-up
- **Appointment Reminders**: Medical, service appointments
- **Survey Calls**: Customer satisfaction, market research
- **Collections**: Payment reminders, account management
- **Notifications**: Alert calls, status updates
- **Follow-up Workflows**: Post-purchase, support follow-ups

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Outbound Testing | Inbound Testing |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Who calls who** | Bluejay â†’ Your Agent | Your Agent â†’ Bluejay |
| **Execution** | Instant | When your agent calls |
| **Concurrency** | Unlimited | One per number |
| **Primary use case** | Customer service | Sales/outreach |
| **Timing control** | Bluejay controls | You control |
| **Test state** | Running/Complete | Ready/Running/Complete |
| **Setup complexity** | Simple | Requires triggering |

## Choosing the Right Testing Direction

### Choose Outbound Testing When:
- Testing customer service scenarios
- You need immediate results and feedback
- Running high-volume or load tests
- Testing response to incoming requests
- Validating IVR flows and call routing
- Testing agent availability and responsiveness

### Choose Inbound Testing When:
- Testing sales or marketing campaigns
- Your agent initiates customer contact
- Testing dialer integrations and workflows
- Validating outreach scripts and processes
- Testing follow-up and reminder systems
- Simulating proactive customer engagement
